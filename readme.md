I've taken a course on Mathematical Analysis and as it turned out, it was so complex.
In this project, I'm helping the students find answers to problems that they have in Mathematical analysis or verify their solutions.
The programming langauge used here is python.
Although Pytorch will be a good fit for this project, I've decided to use only numpy to prevent dependency issues and other related hardware complexities for college students.
